"""
In GroupNorm, channels are divided into groups, and the mean and 
variance are calculated within each group across all instances in a 
batch. This makes GroupNorm's performance less dependent on the batch 
size, and it can maintain its effectiveness even with a batch size of 1. 
This can be particularly useful in applications where memory constraints 
limit the maximum batch size, such as high-resolution image processing.
